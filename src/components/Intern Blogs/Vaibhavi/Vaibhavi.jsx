          Internship Experience: American Express
        </h1>
        <p className="vaibhavi-intro">
          Hello folks, I’m Vaibhavi Shinde, (probably) one of your seniors who’s
          still trying to come to terms with the fact that I’m living through my
          final year of insti life. I hail from Shirdi, Maharashtra (yep, the
          place with the famous Sai Baba temple). Unlike many of my batchmates,
          I joined the Chemistry department at IIT Bombay purely out of my own
          interest and curiosity about what chemistry research is all about
        </p>

        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          You may be wondering how I ended up landing an internship (and a PPO)
          in American Express then - it has nothing to do with Chemistry
          afterall. To make a long story short, I’d say that after giving it
          some time, I realized that higher studies and research is a big
          commitment and I didn’t have the patience to stick with it for the
          rest of my life. Around the same time, my extracurricular pursuits and
          leadership roles had started sparking my interest in the non-chemistry
          fields.
        </p>
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          I was pretty clueless before my third-year internship season. The only
          thing I was sure about was that I didn’t want to pursue research,
          coding, or work in a field or company where my personal well-being
          would take a backseat (yeah, unknowingly, I had already eliminated
          most of the opportunities, lol). But once the internship season began,
          I just wanted to land a decent internship, as the pressure was really
          starting to take a toll on me.
          <p />
          <p className="vaibhavi-description"></p>
          That’s when the overthinking kicked in, and I started doubting my
          worth. I even met a few people who suggested I start ‘apping’ since
          they thought my chances of getting shortlisted were slim, thanks to my
          not-so-great CPI. It was tough to keep faith in myself during that
          time, but honestly, I couldn’t have done it without the amazing
          seniors who were always rooting for me.
          <p />
          <p className="vaibhavi-description"></p>I had a shortlist in Deutsche
          bank but I couldn’t get in. I learned a few major lessons from it
          which helped me to get into American Express.
        </p>

          The Amex Shortlist, Preparation, and Interview:
        </h2>
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          Not getting into Deutsche Bank after reaching round 3 of its
          interviews was disheartening. But I was keen to take feedback - after
          all, it wouldn’t matter how much I prepared for the upcoming companies
          if I didn’t have the right direction to follow. The major feedback for
          me was to develop logical thinking by solving puzzles and strengthen
          my understanding of the technical part that I’d written on my resume.
          I shifted my focus to improve upon these areas.
        </p>
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          Amex’s process included a test followed by a resume shortlist and two
          rounds of interviews. The test consisted of three parts- 1. Aptitude
          2. ML and 3. Business. The first part was compulsory, and we were
          required to solve any one of the latter two. Of course, I solved
          business. I had never coded after the first-year CS 101 course. The
          test went well, and I got the first waitlist.
        </p>
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          I wanted to prepare my best for this. I spoke with multiple seniors
          who worked in Amex, strengthened my resume prep, and read every piece
          of information about Amex available on the internet.
        </p>
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          I got an interview call around 12:30 am. There were two rounds of
          interviews, one focusing majorly on resume and logical thing and the
          other on strategy and HR. I was able to solve puzzles and
          unconventional strategy questions thrown at me. The HR part went
          exceptionally well, as I brought up my knowledge about the company
          while answering the questions, showing that I was true to my
          motivation for joining the company.

          Internship Experience: Summer 2024
        </h2>
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          I was honestly relieved when I found out I’d be joining a strategy
          team rather than the decision sciences or technical team. Those who
          know me well will probably remember my mess table line (though I
          sincerely hope my manager never reads this): “I’d rather sweep the
          floors of Antilia than code for a living.” In hindsight, that was a
          very narrow and thoughtless mindset, and it took quite a few reality
          checks for me to move past it.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          I was beyond excited about my first-ever corporate internship at a
          multinational company. The idea of traveling to a new city, dressing
          up in formals like a 'grown-up,' and earning a salary that matched two
          years of my pocket money - it all felt like a dream. I’ve never felt
          more grateful in my life.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          American Express is a multinational financial services corporation
          specializing in payment cards. Its internal operations are divided
          into various business units, and I was part of the 'Credit and Fraud
          Risk' team. I found my project intellectually stimulating, as it
          focused on estimating key repayment metrics for competitive
          benchmarking, providing interesting insights into the company’s market
          position. The internship program was well-structured, and it allowed
          me to learn the required skills from scratch.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          One of the truly commendable things about Amex is its culture. The
          support system here is unparalleled - you can reach out to anyone for
          help or mentorship (special mention for AJ), and they will never turn
          you away. Even directors and VPs are incredibly down-to-earth and
          approachable, always willing to listen and guide. Amex fosters a
          collaborative, flexible, and non-toxic environment, putting its
          employees' well-being at the forefront of everything. I have
          experienced this first-hand, and I can confidently say that none of
          this is an exaggeration.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          The first half of the internship was nothing short of a rollercoaster
          as I tried to juggle managing SMP along with working on my project and
          building new skills. The initial excitement faded quickly, and
          self-doubt began to creep in as I struggled to meet my own
          expectations. The overthinking that followed made things worse. The
          whole ‘living in a new city’ part also started to bite back,
          especially since, being a people-person, I had never imagined spending
          weekends alone, confined to my room. And let’s not forget - spending
          your 21st birthday alone is its own kind of terrible.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          Looking back, I now realize I had set some seriously unrealistic
          expectations for myself in every area of my life, and when I couldn’t
          meet them, I was very hard on myself. Slowly, though, after talking to
          myself and a few seniors (who have been lifesavers during most of my
          time at insti), I began to find a way out of that mindset. It’s funny
          how being kind to ourselves is rarely emphasized in the communities we
          grow up in, and it often takes years for people to build a positive
          self-image. I truly believe that this whole experience helped me grow
          into a more mature and self-aware person.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          One of my major takeaways from the internship, beyond the technical
          skills and financial concepts, was the importance of seeking regular
          feedback. Embracing feedback with an open mind is essential - it helps
          us identify areas where we can improve and grow as individuals. Every
          phase of life demands a new version of ourselves, and we must face
          these challenges with a mindset that’s willing to evolve and adapt.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          This sounds like a lot of philosophy, huh? But on a more practical
          note, I’d like you to not repeat the mistakes that I made. Please
          NEVER hesitate to speak your mind. It really doesn’t matter what
          others - even your evaluators - think. Ten years from now, no one will
          remember whether you were right or wrong, but you’ll definitely thank
          yourself for having the courage to put your opinions out there instead
          of letting fear of judgement control you.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="vaibhavi-description">
          And of course, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
          I might need a reminder or two (apologies in advance!), but I promise
          I’ll never disappoint when it comes to sharing my bit of life gyaan :)
