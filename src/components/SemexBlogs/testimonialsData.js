      experience: `<b style="color:#333; font-size: 1.3em; text-align: center; padding-top: 10px;">My Research Internship at the University of Zurich: A Journey Beyond Borders</b> <br/> Hello everyone! I’m Ajinkya Dhepe, a B.S. + M.Sc. Dual Degree student who graduated in 2023. I’ve had the privilege of working with some amazing people during my time at IIT Bombay, and I’d like to share a unique experience from my journey—a research internship at the University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland. What sets this story apart is that I completed the internship during the semester! I hope you enjoy reading about this adventure as much as I enjoyed living it.<br/> <b style="color:#333; font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 10px;">A Little Background</b> <br/> I joined IIT Bombay in 2018 as a B.S. Chemistry student and quickly developed a passion for research. I worked on several projects with various professors, most notably with Prof. Arindam Chowdhury on the photophysics of lead-halide perovskites using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. I also completed an online internship with Prof. Pavel Levkin from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, analyzing stress-strain data for PEG-based hydrogels, supported by a DAAD Scholarship.<br/> As I approached my 7th semester, I decided to switch to a dual degree to gain more research experience, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic had limited my in-person opportunities. <br/> <b style="color:#333; font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 10px;">Finding the Right Opportunity</b>  <br/>By the time I entered my final year of the dual degree program, I felt a strong need for more in-person research experience outside India. My undergraduate project mentor, Prof. Arindam Chowdhury, advised me to seek internships abroad to improve my chances of getting into a prestigious graduate program. This was around the end of March, and though it felt a bit late to start searching, I sent out emails to multiple professors.<br/> With a growing interest in biology and biophysics, I targeted professors who used TIRF microscopy—a technique I was already familiar with—to study biological systems. This focus allowed me to craft cover letters that highlighted my existing knowledge and eagerness to apply it to new challenges: Having learned the importance of TIRF microscopy, I am eager to explore its applications in biological systems.<br/> After a month of emailing, I finally received a response from Prof. Pablo Rivera-Fuentes at UZH. Following a brief interview where we discussed my background and research experiences, I secured the internship, along with funding from the lab. (Pro tip: Don’t shy away from mentioning funding during the interview!)<br/> <b style="color:#333; font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 10px;">A Unique Challenge</b> <br/> Balancing Academics and Interning Abroad. Although thrilled to have secured the internship, I soon learned that the lab wouldn’t have a vacancy until the end of July—right when our semester at IITB begins. This news was a bit disheartening. However, after discussing it with my DDP mentor, I decided to work on my project over the summer and then head to UZH during the semester, while remaining enrolled at IITB. After sorting out all the necessary paperwork, I finally made my way to Zurich.<br/>  <b style="color:#333; font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 10px;">The Swiss Dream</b> <br/> Zurich’s beauty was absolutely mesmerizing! Initially, I was a bit overwhelmed by the thought of living so far from home for the first time, but I quickly adapted to city life. The university helped me secure housing before I arrived, which made the transition much smoother. Plus, the jet lag wasn’t too bad! <br/> Working at UZH was one of the most enriching experiences of my life. The lab was equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, and I was fortunate to receive training on advanced equipment. My research focused on using TIRF microscopy to study dye photophysics and implementing machine learning to differentiate fluorescent signals from background noise. I was mentored by an incredible guide who helped me navigate the project and grow as a budding researcher. I also enjoyed participating in lab activities like hikes, boating, and dinners, which further motivated me to apply for PhD programs. <br/> Although there were days when things didn’t go as planned despite hours of work, the process of troubleshooting and eventually seeing results was incredibly rewarding<br/> <b style="color:#333; font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 10px;">Looking Back Reflections and Advice</b> <br/> This internship was a significant boost to my CV and helped me secure a letter of recommendation for my graduate school applications. While I did miss a couple of months at IITB and wasn’t able to take a few extra courses I was interested in, the hands-on experience in a field I’m passionate about, along with the opportunity to work in a research facility abroad, was truly invaluable. <br/> For those considering research internships, here are a few tips: <ol> <li><b>Don’t be afraid to try something new</b>. Internships are the perfect opportunity to explore different areas and see what truly excites you.</li> <li><b>Relate your past experiences to the lab’s work</b>. This not only strengthens your application but also makes the internship more meaningful.</li> <li><b>Failure is part of the process.</b> Research doesn’t always go as planned, but each setback is a learning opportunity.</li> <li><b>Set learning goals with your mentor.</b> Remember, not every internship needs to result in a publication.</li> <li><b>Engage with others in the lab.</b> Shadow their experiments, ask about their research, and build connections—networking is crucial in academia.</li> <li><b>Don’t forget to explore and enjoy your stay!</b> Embrace the experience of living in a new place.</li> </ol>`
